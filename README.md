# Neural-Network-OCR

A canvas where you can draw out any letter or digit, and the neural network will recognize it and return it as copyable text. Uses a neural networks with 3 hidden layers each to classify the drawn character into a digit or a letter.

This neural network utilizes the EMNIST dataset.
